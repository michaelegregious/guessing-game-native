## Guessing Game for React Native

This is an exercise to expolore styling and logic with React Native. If you'd like to check it out, there are a few ways to run a React Native App. For a more involved explanation, check out the [Create React App Readme File](https://github.com/michaelegregious/guessing-game-native/blob/master/React-Native-README.md). If you have XCode on your computer, and want to see this app in a simulator there, use the instructions below, but instead of 'npm start' use 'npm run ios'. Likewise, you can run 'npm run android' for an Android device or simulator.

The following version is to run the app on your phone, and requires you to first download the Expo app (so do that now).

### Setup

To run this app on your local machine, you'll need to:

1. Open your terminal
2. cd Desktop (if you want to self-title your own folder complete step 3-6, otherwise skip to step 5)
3. mkdir guessing-game-native
4. cd guessing-game-native
5. git clone https://github.com/michaelegregious/guessing-game-native
6. Open in your text editor of choice
7. npm install
8. npm start
9. This will enter a dialogue in your terminal, that will ask for your phone number, and then text you a link which can be opened in Expo. It may take a minute to bundle the JS file the first time.
